## Legal news

### Creation

The french legal entity is now open and Foxrift is revving its engine.

### Challenges

In Q1, Foxrift will open itself to social networks. It will also claim legal licenses such as android, iOS, unity, advertisement companies, etc.

## Roadmap

We'll start working on three new projects :
* Honey
* Shinto
* Fusilli

These names are placeholders until released.

### Shinto, priority 0

Shinto will be an educational game for japanese learners. It won't stand alone for learning but will add a new dimension to learn japanese.
It targets iOS and Android devices. Free app with in-app purchase and ads.

Though the core is finished, the monetization and design need to be improved.  
**Release : Q1-Q2**

### Honey, priority 1

Honey is a game around bees developped using Unity and targetting iOS and Android devices.  
It will be a free game, with in-app purchases and advertisement.

Honey has a first working version but it needs to be improved. It lacks addiction and renewal.  
**Release : Q2-Q3**

### Fusilli, priority 2

Fusilli is on a very different level. It aims to be an international platform.  
It implies :
* Apps
* Website
* Backends
* Specific privacy policy, terms of service, support, security, scalability, etc

The business model won't be disclosed prior to release.  
**Release : Q4+**
