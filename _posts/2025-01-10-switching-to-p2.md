## General news

As of 2025, we are now entering phase 2 with development as the main goal of Foxrift. For that occasion we've equipped ourselved with brand new stuff !

## Roadmap

We'll start working on four new projects :

* Honey
* Coconut
* Fusilli

These names are placeholders until released.

We'll also start creating YouTube and TikTok content!

### Shinto, priority 0

Shinto will be an educational game for japanese learners. It won't stand alone for learning but will add a new dimension to learn japanese.
It targets iOS and Android devices. Free app with in-app purchase and ads.

Though the core is finished, the monetization and design need to be improved.  
**Release : Q1-Q2**

### Honey, priority 1

Honey is a game around bees developped using Unity and targetting iOS and Android devices.  
It will be a free game, with in-app purchases and ads.

Honey has a first working version but it needs to be improved. It lacks addiction and renewal.
**Release : Q2-Q3**

### Coconut, priority 2

Coconut is a VR sport game targetted for Meta Quest 2/3. We want it it be efficient, addictive, interactive and funny.

Coconut will be a game for the Meta Store, and will be available on Steam probably in 2025.
**Release : Q4**

### Fusilli, priority 3

Fusilli is on a very different level. It aims to be an international platform.  
It implies :
* Apps
* Website
* Backends
* Specific privacy policy, terms of service, support, security, scalability, etc

The business model won't be disclosed prior to release.  
**Release : 2025**
