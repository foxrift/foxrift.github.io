<h3>11/06/22 - MFFG termination scheduled</h3>

MFFG has been an awesome 3 years adventure.
<br>It has been a lot of work to answer every single request you sent by email.
<br>Following the previous post about MFFG accuracy and the inability to track the prefecture appointments, as well as the inability for MFFG to change the internal system before the end of 2023, it has been decided to discountinue MFFG.
<br>
<br>As a result, <strong>MFFG will stop working on 31st August 2022, 23h59 french time.</strong>
<br>Especially :
<ul>
    <li>The applications will stop working as well as the notification system</li>
    <li>The Facebook page will be terminated</li>
</ul>
<strong>Starting today, MFFG will not treat any email anymore.</strong>
<br>If the schedule allows it, building MFFG2 in the end of 2023 will be considered.
<br>
<br>If you are a developer or a company and are insterested in buying MFFG source code you can <a href = "mailto:thanhhongdo.pro@gmail.com?subject=[MFFG] Source code offer">contact me</a>.
